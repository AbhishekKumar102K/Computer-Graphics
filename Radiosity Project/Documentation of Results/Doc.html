		<h2 align ="left">Summary of Algorithm</h2>
		<P>This algorithm computes the radiosity of each face using the <i>Hemicube method</i>(for calculating the form-factor).
			It then interpolates the vertex colors by taking the average across all the neighbouring faces
			to give an aesthetically pleasing scene.
		</P>
		<h2 align ="left">Description of Algorithm</h2>
		<p>
			The file parser function loads the object file and stores it in an array. It calculates normal vector of each face
			by using the vertex coordinates. After a given environment is broken down into a set of polygons, energy 
			exchange between all pairs of elements are evaluated. This evaluation is called Form Factor calculation.
			
			We used <i>Hemicube method</i> to calculate the form factor for each pair of faces instead of using the <i>Double Integration Method</i>.
			<ul>
			<li>
			<h3>Hemicube Method</h3>
			<p>
				For each face we imagined a unit hemicube with center coinciding with the centroid of the face.
				We then create a view port as each of the five faces of the hemicube and thereby, render the entire scene
				on to the viewport. The form-factor is given by the ratio of the area of the hemicube
				that is lightened by the face to the total area of the hemicube (3*a*a).
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of going by the method mentioned in the paper i.e. <i>The Double Integration Method</i> we
				used the <i>Hemicube method</i> because the evaluation of form factor in the former method
				is numerically complex and computationally demanding. Thus, it is a high cost operation.
				Also, the form factor calculation between two patches has to take into account any intervening
				patches. This is made possible using the hemicube method.
			</p></li><br/>
			<li><h3>Calculation Of The Radiosities</h3>
			<p>
				For each face we calculate its radiosity using the formula given in the research paper by iterating 
				over all the faces which is basically the sum of emission terms and the product of corresponding 
				form factor, reflectivity and radiosity.
			</p></li><br/>
			<img src="Equation.png" alt="Equation of the Radiosity" class ="center">
			<li><h3>Interpolation</h3>
			<p>
				If we just display the faces with the final radiosity of each face as its 
				color value then the scene looks like it is composed of differently coloured 
				triangular faces rather than a smooth surface.<br/>
				To get rid of this, we used a linear interpolation algorithm.</li><br/>

				<b>The way this function works is by assigning each vertex a color value which
				is equal to the average of the radiosity values of its neighboring faces.
				Now all the three vertices of each face will have different color values
				which produces a gradient of the resulting colours across the faces, thereby 
				producing a smoother color transition.</b>
			
			</p>
			<br/>		
		</p></ul>
		<h2>Implementation Of The Code</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Loading the object file</b> : We read the object file of the scene that we created using <u>Blender</u>.<br/>
			<b>*</b> For each new object in the scene, we set its reflectivity (colour) and emissivity (Light emission intensity)
			 , being represented as a triplet of RGB values, as per our needs. This determines how the object will
			 look like in the final scene.	<br/>
			<b>*</b> For each vertex in the object file, we add it to a vector (vertices) which stores triplets of the XYZ coordinates
			 of each vertex. <br/>
			<b>*</b> For each face in the object file, we add it to a vector (faces) that stores vertex indices
			 being used to defined the face. Since all faces are triangular i.e. having three vertices, each index of the
             faces vector contains a triplet of the vertex indices. <br/>
			 The reflectivities and emission value for each face is also stored in respective vectors.
			</li><br/>
			<li>
				<b>Calculating the form factors</b> :This was perhaps the most time consuming part of the entire project. While trying to figure out a method
			to evaluate the double integrals, we came across the hemicube method (that was published in SIGGRAPH
			in the subsequent year) which reduces the computation required for calculating the form factors. It also
			exploits the z-buffer hardware to take care of intervening patches, that couldn't be done using the double integral
			method.
			Thus due to the reduced computation time, we were able to create a scene with a larger number of subdivisions(faces)
			and thus a higher resolution.<br/>
			Steps for calculating form factor using hemicube method:<br/>
			<b>*</b> For each face, we first set up a unit hemicube with its base centre coinciding with the centroid of the face.
			Using the face2pixel function, each face index is mapped to a unique non-(0,0,0) RGB value. Then the entire scene 
			is rendered on to each face of the hemicube with the color value from the encoding function.<br/>
			<b>*</b> Then we count all those pixels that are lit(having color non-(0,0,0)). Decoding the color of the pixel gives us 
			the face that resulted in the pixel getting lit.<br/>
			<b>*</b> Repeat this for all the faces of the hemicube and count the total number of pixels lit by each face.
			Divide this number(for each face) by the total number of pixels on the hemicube (that is 3*a*a, where a is the resolution
			of the hemicube) and we get the form factor.<br/>
			</li><br/>
			
			<li>
				<b>Calculating the radiosities and Linear Interpolation </b>: The radiosities are calculated using the same
				formula as given in the research paper (i.e. the Energy Equation)
				This includes taking the sum of products of radiosity, form factor and the 
				reflectivity of all the faces in the scene and adding it to the emission value of that face.
				Thus, we have the final calculated radiosities of all the faces.
				Next we use linear interpolation, as described above, to smoothen out the colors.
				This is done by assigning a color value to a vertex which is equal to the average of all the radiosity values
				of all the faces it is a part of.
			</li><br/>
		</ul>
		<h2>Implementation Issues</h2>
			<p>
			To implement the paper, we divided the above mentioned algorithm into three main steps:<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Since the radiosity array is filled in a bottom up manner (in increasing face index),
				no face affects the radiosity of a face placed before it in the array. This 
				led to implementation errors. To resolve this, we had to call the calculate radiosity
				function twice so that each face could interact and affect the radiosity of the other</li><br/>
				<li>
					Calculation of the form factors takes a lot of time which varies quadratically with 
					the number of faces. The scene we created using blender has 4258 faces and it takes 
					roughly a minute to compute the form factors. Thus, we weren't able to figure out a way
					to reduce the time down to a few seconds
				
				</li><br/>
				<li>
					For the triple.h header file, we had previously defined the functions in the header file 
					itself, which led to unexplained errors in the code. Making the functions inline seemed to 
					resolve the issue.
				
				</li><br/>
				
			</ul>
			</p>
			
		<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Since the form factor vector is 2D a vector, we have to compute form factors 
			for every pair of faces that exists in the scene. We also rasterize the entire 
			scene to the faces of the hemicube which takes linear time for all faces.
			Thus, Time Complexity of the function is O(n^2) where n is the number of faces in the scene.</li><br/>

			<li>For the double intergation method, we have to further divide the perimeter of each face 
			into segments for evaluating the integral. <br/>
			So, if there are n faces and each face perimeter is being divided m segments, the overall 
			time complexity is O(n^2 m^2) This can grow to O(n^4) if the number of faces is equal to the 
			number of segments.</li><br/>
		</ul>

			Hence, we can notice significant improvement in the efficiency of calculating form factors
			using the hemicube method as compared to the method mentioned in the paper.
		</p>
			
			
			
		<h2>Results</h2>
			We have successfully implemented the algorithm for calculation of radiosities and extrapolated the knowledge
			to create more than what the paper offered.<br/>
			Here are some insights on the algorithm from what we observed :<br/>
		<ul>
		
			<li>
				<b>Color Bleeding</b> : Through this phenomenon we tend to see shades of color from one object on to
				the other objects. This is not observed in case of the standard lighting model in OpenGL. Thus, we were
				able to render realistic looking scenes.<br/>

						<img src="colorbleeding2.jpeg" style="width:100%">
					</div>
 
				</div>	
			</li><br/>
			
			<li>
				<b>Absence of OpenGL lights</b> : A peculiar feature of using the radiosity approach is that we don't 
				have to use a separate light model. Instead each face has it's own emission and reflectivity values
				which dictates it's behaviour in the final scene.
