	<h2 align ="left">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		In this Assignment we have tried to create a 3D scene of an Auditorium using OpenGL Transformations,
		matrix stack operations, and 3D viewing pipeline. We have also used Blender to create objects like <b>Speakers, Mic and
		Podium</b> and then exported them into our scene. 
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 align ="left">Classes Used And Their Brief Description</h2>
	 <h3>
		We used various classes and functions to make our code look more organised and easy to understand. Here
		are all the classes that we used to make this Auditorium and a brief description about them.
	 </h3>
	 
	 <ul>
		<li><h4>Audi Class : </h4> This class creates the basic structure of the auditorium including all the walls, the entrance and the stage
		of the Auditorium.
		</li>
		<li>
		<h4>Blender_imp Class : </h4> This Class is used to import all the blender objects into the Auditorium. It includes
		functions like make_speakers(), make_podium() and make_mic().
		</li>
		<li><h4>Chair Class :</h4> This Class is used to make the seats of the Auditorium.</li> 
		<li><h4>Exitgate Class : </h4> This Class makes the Exits of the auditorium.</li>
		<li><h4>Light Class : </h4> This Class makes the Ceiling lights of the Auditorium.</li>
		<li><h4>Reader Class : </h4>This Class is responsible for reading the object files created by blender and then
			finally drawing these objects using glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE)function.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<h4>Cuboid Class : </h4> This Class makes the Cubes, Cuboids for the scene.
		
		</li>
		
		<li><h4>Stair Class : </h4> This Class makes the floor steps of the auditorium.</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <h2>Controls Of The Scene</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>'W' : </b>Rotate The camera about X-axis in Counter-Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'S' : </b>Rotate The camera about X-axis in Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'A' : </b>Rotate The camera about Y-axis in Counter-Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'D' : </b>Rotate The camera about Y-axis in Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'Q' : </b>Rotate The camera about Z-axis in Counter-Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'E' : </b>Rotate The camera about Z-axis in Clockwise Sense</li>
			<li><b>'O' : </b>Move The camera upwards</li>
			<li><b>'L' : </b>Move The camera downwards</li>
			<li><b>';' : </b>Move The camera Right</li>
			<li><b>'K' : </b>Move The camera Left</li>
			<li><b>'=' : </b>Move The camera BackWards</li>
			<li><b>'-' : </b>Move The camera Inwards</li>
			<li><b>'R' : </b>Reset The camera to the initial position</li>
		
		
		
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Implementaion Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Importing complex shapes and objects from Blender leads to memory overflow.
				It also increases the time complexity of the program because of having to draw many polygons. Thus, we have imported only simple and basic objects.
			
			</li>
			<li>Due to lack of shadows and lighting, the solid color given to the objects makes them look like
				one polygon instead of a 3D object. You may notice this in the Podium which looks like a 2d Outline of an object as it
				loses its identity as a 3d podium.
			</li>
			<li>
				The shape of the floor of the Auditorium is trapezium due to which we couldn't arrange Chairs properly one behind the other and mantain uniformity.
				This lead to the chair arrangement looking visually unaesthetic.
			
			</li>
			
		</ul>
