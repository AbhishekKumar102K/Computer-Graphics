			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				For this assignment, we used lines(to draw the edges) and circles(to represent a node) to draw the binary tree. For this, we used the <i>Bresenham's Midpoint Line and circle drawing algorithm</i>.
				We modified the circle drawing algorithm by adding an offset to both the x and y coordinate to draw the circles at any other location than the origin.
				This program has two different ways of taking input from the user. <br />
				We have implemented TR algorithm after going through the given research paper. It contains two functions, namely <b>setup()</b> and <b>Petrify()</b>. <br />
				The <b>setup()</b> function assigns threads and offsets to each node and the <b>Petrify()</b> function assigns X-coordinate to each node.
			</p>
			<br />

			<h2>General Discussion on the Algorithm</h2>
			<p>
				The <b>WS Algorithm (Tidy drawing)</b> was successful in drawing a tidy tree but it failed to form a tree having minimum width. Moreover, it was
				assymetric and hence, aesthetically unpleasing.<br />
				On the other hand, the <b>TR Algorithm (Tidier drawing)</b> which we have implemented in this assignment successfully draws a Tidy Tree as well as
				maintains minimum width and symmetry, hence, produces an aesthetically pleasing binary tree.<br />
				This algorithm starts by superimposing two subtrees at their roots and then moving them apart till a minimum separation is maintained. For keeping track of the
				contours and the separation between them, we use threads which are essentially pointers that point to the next node on the contour.<br />
				The setup() function assigns relative positionings to each node during a postorder traversal and assigns these threads.<br />
				The petrify() function changes the relative coordinates to absolute coordinates.


			</p>
			<br />

			<h2>Issues in Coding</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>

					<li>
						As n gets large, circles become very small and almost disappear. For n>2000, it draws a straight line instead of tree, as <i>'sx'</i>(scaling factor)
						becomes too small or almost 0.
					</li>
					<li>
						To clip the lines that are inside the circles, we assumed that the change in x and y will be rcos45 i.e r/1.414, where r is the radius of the circle
						So this leads to the lines not seeming to pass through the centres of the two nodes it is connecting.
						For this we need to do floating point calculation in each recursive call, which causes the program to crash.
					</li>
					<li>
						The y coordinates (levels) assigned to each node during pre calculation are positive(0, 1, 2... so on). But since a binary tree is an inverted tree
						in which the y coordinate of the topmost node should be maximum, we had to multiply the y coordinate by -1.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Timing Analysis</h2>
			 <p>
				 Since each node is being accessed once in the recursive setup() function and as mentioned in the given 
				 research paper, the body of the while loop is executed n(T)-h(T) times (n(T)-> number of nodes, h(T) -> height of the tree)
				 , the overall function is linear in n(T) i.e. The number of the nodes in the tree.<br/>
				 Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n(T)).<br/>
				 Even during multiple runs of our program, we noticed increasing time of execution as the number of nodes increased.
				 This was supported by printing the time taken in each execution using the clock function.

		<br />
		<p>As we see in the graph, the time is linear with the number of nodes. Hence the time complexity is O(n).</p>
